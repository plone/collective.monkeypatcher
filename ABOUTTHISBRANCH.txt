About this branch
=================

This branch has been built copying version '1.0a2' (rev. #83392) of
collective.monkeypatcher form the trunk at
https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.monkeypatcher/trunk

This branch is an experimental improvement of collective.monkeypatcher. It's
aimed at adding following features:

* A placeless control panel in the Zope root (as PTS or "Databases") that shows
  all monkey patches.

* A mention of the monkey patch in the docstring such it shows up in the methods
  doc in "DocFinderTab".
